    The risks associated with the news article about the iPhone 15 range being more expensive than current models can be categorized as follows:
    
    - Decrease in user demand: Market Risk
    - Price increases: Market Risk
    - Brand reputation damage: Reputational Risk
    - Decrease in product quality: Reputational Risk, Legal and Compliance Risk, Customer Dissatisfaction Risk, Supply Chain Disruption Risk, and Strategic Partner Risk. To mitigate these risks, Apple could consider offering financing options, improving customer experience, expanding into new markets, diversifying product offerings, investing in research and development, prioritizing customer satisfaction, investing in quality control measures, and providing excellent customer service."""
